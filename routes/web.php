| Here is where you can register web routes for your application. These
| routes are loaded by the RouteServiceProvider within a group which
| contains the "web" middleware group. Now create something great!
|
| All routes are now handled by modules:
| - Auth module: handles authentication routes
| - Admin module: handles admin routes
| - User module: handles user/frontend routes
